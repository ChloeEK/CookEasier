You will then download the project files and save it on your computer – the project files are called “Cook Easier”

Open the android studio application and open “Cook Easier” into Android Studio
The application will prompt you to open a file and that is when you will open Cook easier

Once the project has completely been loaded, you will go to build  build bundle/apk  build apks 

Then you make sure the android device emulator is set up. You will click this button in the top right corner. If there isn’t an emulator already installed click create device and pick the latest pixel phone application.

Once emulator is instantiated, you will press the play button (same row as the device emulator button) and an emulator phone will appear and the app will load. 

Navigation throughout the App
The app should be very easy to understand and use as that is the main part of my usability goals. I will provide instructions on how to navigate. This high fidelity prototype only contains one recipe and that is for the breakfast hash. It was unnecessary to provide recipes for other categories before testing for final changes.
